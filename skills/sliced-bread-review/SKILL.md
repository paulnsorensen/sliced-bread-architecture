  rules: dependency direction, crust integrity, model purity, growth
  justification, and event usage. Use when the user asks for an architecture
  review, says "check this against sliced bread", "review the slice

  bug-hunting or a full repo audit — this reviews a bounded change set.

# Sliced Bread Review

Review the target change set against the Sliced Bread architecture. The full
rationale lives at
<https://cheeselord.dev/sliced-bread-architecture/reference/sliced-bread/>;
this skill is the operational checklist.

## Scope

Determine the review target from the invocation, in priority order:

1. An explicit path, diff, branch, or PR named by the user.
2. The current branch's diff against the default branch.
3. Uncommitted changes (`git diff HEAD`).

Review only the changed files plus any file a changed import points at.

## The Five Checks

Run every check against every changed file. Cite `file:line` and quote the
offending import or definition for each finding.

### 1. Import direction

Arrows may only point in a permitted direction. Only the composition root
(`app/bootstrap`, `main`) may import concrete adapters, and nothing imports
`entrypoints/`. A slice may import a sibling slice's public seam directly.
The arrows describe permitted direction, not required directories — a repo with
no `entrypoints/` layer is not in violation.

<!-- doctrine:arrows:start -->

```text
entrypoints/   ->  app/  ->  domains/*  ->  domains/common/
app/bootstrap  ->  adapters/          (composition root only)
adapters/      ->  domains/*          (implement domain ports)

Never:
  app/use_cases/*  ->  adapters/*
  domains/*        ->  adapters/ | app/ | entrypoints/
  adapters/*       ->  app/ | entrypoints/
  common/          ->  sibling domains
  anything         ->  entrypoints/
```

<!-- doctrine:arrows:end -->

Apply the checked doctrine:severity-cases matrix in first-match order. Do not
restate severity outcomes in runtime guidance outside that matrix.

### 2. Crust integrity

External consumers use a slice's public seam in the language's native form —
exported identifiers in Go, the package `__init__` surface in Python, an index
module in TypeScript, a public class surface elsewhere — never its internals.
`from domains.pricing import calculate_discount` is fine;
`from domains.pricing.discount_calculator import ...` is a violation —
**high** with multiple consumers, **low** with one.

### 3. Model purity

Domain files import only stdlib, `common/`, and sibling slice public APIs.
A domain file importing an HTTP client, ORM, or queue is a violation; the fix
is a port (protocol) defined in the domain and implemented by an adapter. Apply
the checked severity matrix rather than inferring an outcome from this guidance.

### 4. Growth justification

Every new directory or abstraction needs 2+ concrete uses. An abstract base
with one implementation, an event bus interface when no event exists yet, or a
registry with one plugin is premature abstraction; apply the checked growth
matrix rather than inferring an outcome from this guidance. "Numeric
thresholds" in the guards below means the advisory growth signals (~200 lines,
3+ concepts, 3+ clustered files), not this check. Suppress these false
positives:

<!-- doctrine:growth-guards:start -->

- New single-file concepts that stayed single files are correct; do not flag them.
- A dispatcher introduced to break a cross-slice cycle is not premature abstraction, even with one event and one subscriber.
- Numeric thresholds are advisory signals, not gradeable violations; grade implementation share, public-surface size, and lifetime mixing.
- In a language whose only privacy mechanism is file placement, a subdirectory that exists to mark its contents internal is the visibility mechanism, not growth structure; do not grade it against the 2+-concrete-uses check, even with a single file inside.

<!-- doctrine:growth-guards:end -->

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- doctrine:growth-cases:start -->

| ID | Given | Expected | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `growth-cycle-event` | An event dispatcher is introduced to break a cross-slice cycle. | `allow` | The dispatcher removes a concrete cycle and is a canonical exception to the pressure-first growth signal. |
| `growth-positional-one-file` | A one-file positional crust marks internal visibility in a language without another privacy mechanism. | `allow` | The directory is a visibility boundary rather than speculative growth structure, even when it contains one file. |
| `growth-single-unpressured` | A new abstraction has one concrete consumer and no demonstrated pressure. | `medium` | The normal two-concrete-consumer signal has not been met, so the abstraction should be challenged as premature rather than treated as a blocker. |

<!-- doctrine:growth-cases:end -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Apply these growth outcomes in order; the event-dispatcher and one-file
positional-crust cases are explicit exceptions to the normal pressure signal.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- doctrine:severity-cases:start -->

| ID | Given | Expected | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `severity-import-exec` | A domain module executes infrastructure work while it is imported. | `blocker` | Import-time side effects make every consumer pay infrastructure cost and can fail before application startup is controlled. |
| `severity-static-domain-infra` | A domain model has a static dependency on infrastructure. | `medium` | The dependency violates model purity and increases change coupling, but a static edge alone is not an import-time execution failure. |
| `severity-static-concrete-adapter` | A use case or application service imports a concrete adapter instead of a domain port. | `medium` | The application layer is coupled to infrastructure selection; dependency injection through a port restores the intended boundary. |
| `severity-other-forbidden-edge` | A dependency edge points in a forbidden direction and does not match a more specific severity case. | `blocker` | Unmatched structural inversions break the slice dependency contract and require immediate correction. |

<!-- doctrine:severity-cases:end -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Apply the checked doctrine:severity-cases matrix in first-match order; do not
infer outcomes from prose outside the matrix.

### 5. Event usage

Events exist for reverse dependencies: B reacts to A without A knowing B.
Cycles between slices must resolve via events typed in `common/`, not mutual
imports (**high**).
Events used as general-purpose messaging where a direct import is the natural
dependency are a **medium** finding.

## Severity

The severities cited in the checks above derive from this table.

<!-- doctrine:severity:start -->

| Severity | Meaning                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| blocker  | Inverted dependency arrow; infrastructure executing at import time in a domain file                                                                                  |
| high     | Cross-slice internal import; circular slice dependency; crust bypass with multiple consumers                                                                         |
| medium   | Model-purity drift (infrastructure imported, not executed at import time); premature abstraction; events-as-messaging; adapter imported outside the composition root |
| low      | Single-consumer crust bypass; naming drift                                                                                                                           |

<!-- doctrine:severity:end -->

## Output

Report findings grouped by severity, most severe first. Each finding:
`severity — check — file:line — quoted evidence — one-line fix`. An empty
report is a valid outcome; never manufacture findings. Do not fix anything —
this skill reviews only.
